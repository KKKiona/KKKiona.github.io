# Regression
## Regression analysis
In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome variable') and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', or 'features'). The most common form of regression analysis is **linear regression**, in which a researcher finds the line (or a more complex linear combination) that most closely fits the data according to a specific mathematical criterion.

## Regeression application case
What is regression? It's a function where we input training data to exercise machines. Machines can automatically output predict data which we need as we input new data after through sufficient training. We can input Stock Market, for example, then machine will output the stock tendency, input road scene then angle of steering wheel will be output. So it seems like we can input any kind of data and we will get different results.

## Example application
Now we use pokemon as an example to show the details. For this task, suppose that we have got a pokemon like "Bulbasaur" which HP is 10, category is "Grass" and "Poision" and both weight and height are known, and the most important information is **CP** which value  presents the pokemon's combat capacity. This CP's value will be changed as the pokemon evolves, its final value may depend on category, HP or weight and height, even all of them. So what we need to do is design a function that can accurately predict the after-evolved value.
### Scenario, Task and Model
#### Scenario
We have got training data including some prior-evolved and after-evolved pokemon information, so that we can use this date to construct our function and validate the validity of the results.
#### Task
The task is designed by type of the function, beacause the pokemon's CP is a scalar, the task is regression.
#### Model
There are many models that can be used in this scenario, which this chosen is Non-linear Model.
#### Specific parameters
$X$: represent a pokemon, symbol's subscript is pokemon's properties
$X_{cp}$: represent prior-evolved CP
$x_{s}$: represent the category
$x_{hp}$: represent the HP
$x_{w}$: represent the weight
$x_{h}$: represent the height
$f()$: represent the function which we need
$y$: represent the output value namely CP, which is a scalar

## Regression process
### Three steps of machine learning
1. Define a model that is function set.
2. Define a loss function to evaluate a function of the model.
3. Find the best function
### Step1: Model(function set)
How to choose a model often rely on experience.
#### Linear Model
$$y=b+w*X_{cp}$$
$w$ and $b$ represents unknow parameters, it can be any values.

According to different $w$ and $b$, we can make sure infinite functions. $y=b+w*X_{cp}$ is abstract of functions called model, and those functions called function sets.

This is an **Linear Model**, in fact, just considered prior-evolved CP, therefore we can expand this function to such structure:
$$y=b+\sum w_{i}x_{i}$$
$x_{i}$: an attribute of input $X$ ($x_{i}$ is also called feature)
$w_{i}$: weight of $x_{i}$
$b$: bias
